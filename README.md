# About UI

I designed the UI as a dashboard layout because I believe it is more convenient and user-friendly for enterprise/corporate users. This way, users won’t get confused when checking or adding products. As for the color, I chose a soft tone using Tailwind’s default gray-900 to ensure it’s easy on the eyes.
